Run testGPIO.py to test the GPIOWrapper.py
Use the GPIOWrapper.py once it works to easily talk to all the GPIO pins

Where I copied everything from:
https://github.com/derekstavis/python-sysfs-gpio/blob/master/sysfs/gpio.py

The files that need to be written to are explained here (2nd codebox):
http://elinux.org/Jetson/Tutorials/GPIO

You might need another function that releases the files which I am writing to.
